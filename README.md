# Automation Bootcamp Final Project

Automation Testing is used to speed up testing of software to save time and cost and improve accuracy. During the bootcamp, we were taught two frameworks, WebdriverIo and Cypress with the use of JavaScript. Cypress was chosen to complete the final project. In this project, various areas of the Quality Camp E-commerce website will be automated.

## Dependencies
NodeJS (v12, v14 or above)
NPM (v6 or above)
Code editor (Visual Studio Code)
JavaScript v.17
GitBash

## Installation

Install the following packages in your terminal.

```bash
#For cypress
npm install cypress --save-dev
npx cypress open
#For reporter
npm install --save-dev mochawesome mochawesome-merge mochawesome-report-generator
npm install --save-dev npm-run-all
#For Iframe
npm install cypress-iframe --save

```

## Commands

```javascript

# opens cypress GUI
'npx cypress open'
# Select E2E testing, then Chrome browser then start

# runs all test and generated report in default browser window
'npm test'

# runs tests
'npm cypress run'
```


## Points to note

Run test suites in the Cypress GUI, therefore, run the command
```
npx cypress open
```
And run test suites present. The email address for Authentication test 1 will have to be changed if the test is being ran more than once. If at anytime the test may fail(flaky) refresh the test using the refresh button at the top right hand corner in the Cypress GUI
